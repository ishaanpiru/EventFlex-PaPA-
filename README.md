# EventFlex-PaPA-
 PaPA offers a solution enabling users to pay for their attendance duration at DAO events, tackling wasteful NFT purchases for specific segments.
 Introduction:  

# Background Topics 

1) Blockchain Fundamentals: Understand the basics of blockchain technology, including decentralized networks, consensus mechanisms, smart contracts. 

2) Ethereum : Dive deeper into Ethereum, the most popular platform for building decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Understand its architecture, the role of nodes, gas fees, and its ecosystem. 

3) Superfluid Protocol: Explore the Superfluid protocol in detail. Understand how it enables real-time token streaming, its architecture, key components, and the problems it aims to solve. 

4) Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Dive into the world of DeFi and understand how blockchain technology is revolutionizing traditional finance & the shift to Web3. 

5) Smart Contracts: Gain a deep understanding of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. 

6) User Experience (UX): Explore ways to improve the user experience of decentralized applications. 

 

# Motivation of the project 

The purpose of this project is to create a intiutive and user friendly platform on which users can pay as per their attendence which is powered by blockchain technology. 

we aim to develop a Decentralized Event Payment System that allows attendees to pay based on the duration of their attendance, rather than a fixed package, improving flexibility and value. This system will integrate blockchain technology for secure and a payment model based on the duration of attendence, with features such as real-time price data retrieval and decentralized file storage.  to achieve this payment stream generation we will be using superfluid protocol 

 

# Application Domain of the project problem 

 

Our Decentralized Event Payment System is designed to support various digital event sectors, primarily benefiting decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and their members. It serve to the needs of attendees, organizers, sponsors, and content creators across esports, gaming, digital content creation, community engagement, brand marketing, and NFT marketplaces. The system provides flexible payment options, efficient event management tools, innovative marketing channels, and exclusive NFT integration.


# Algortihms Devised 

 

Our system utilizes the Superfluid gateway to calculate payment amounts in real-time, adjusting them based on the duration attendees spend at each event segment. These calculations ensure fair and accurate billing, providing attendees with proof of attendance. By managing costs and resources efficiently, event organizers can ensure a smooth event experience for everyone involved. 

Steps of the proposed System 

 

 

•⁠  ⁠User registration and login: The application allows users to register and log in using their Metamask wallet address 

•⁠  ⁠Event Creation: Organizations can create events specifying:  

a. Title, description, and category.  

b. Start and end time of the event (or set it as a continuous  

stream).  

c. Superfluid stream rate (amount of cryptocurrency per  

unit time). 

•⁠  ⁠Event Discovery: Users can browse and search for events based on various criteria (category, date, etc.). 

•⁠  ⁠Micropayments with Superfluid: Our project offers a unique payment model where users only pay for the time they spend watching, potentially making it more cost-effective. 

•⁠  ⁠VLAD Discord Bot : Discord bot to facilitate event registration and interaction within Discord channels. 

 

# Novelty/Application Innovations 

 

Our system introduces a distinctive approach by offering flexible payment structures tailored to individual attendee preferences, breaking away from traditional fixed-rate models where attendees are required to pay the total fees regardless of their actual attendance. This innovation promotes inclusivity and engagement by empowering attendees to pay solely for the specific event segments they participate in, providing them with freedom and flexibility. This benefits both creators and attendees: creators gain increased attention as costs are based on unit time, incentivizing the delivery of high-quality content. Furthermore, the integration of blockchain technology ensures transparent and secure payment processing, enhancing trust and reliability within the system.
